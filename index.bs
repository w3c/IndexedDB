Title: Indexed Database API (Second Edition)
Shortname: IndexedDB
Abstract: This document defines APIs for a database of records holding
    simple values and hierarchical objects. Each record consists of a key
    and some value. Moreover, the database maintains indexes over records
    it stores. An application developer directly uses an API to locate
    records either by their key or by using an index. A query language can
    be layered on this API. An indexed database can be implemented using a
    persistent B-tree data structure.

<h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

User agents need to store large numbers of objects locally in order to
satisfy off-line data requirements of Web applications. [[WEBSTORAGE]]
is useful for storing pairs of keys and their corresponding values.
However, it does not provide in-order retrieval of keys, efficient
searching over values, or storage of duplicate values for a key.

This specification provides a concrete API to perform advanced
key-value data management that is at the heart of most sophisticated
query processors. It does so by using transactional databases to store
keys and their corresponding values (one or more per key), and
providing a means of traversing keys in a deterministic order. This is
often implemented through the use of persistent B-tree data structures
that are considered efficient for insertion and deletion as well as
in-order traversal of very large numbers of data records.


<aside class=example>
In the following example, the API is used to access a "library"
database that holds books stored by their "isbn" attribute.
Additionally, an index is maintained on the "title" attribute of the
objects stored in the object store. This index can be used to look up
books by title, and enforces a uniqueness constraint. Another index is
maintained on the "author" attribute of the objects, and can be used
to look up books by author.

A connection to the database is opened. If the "library" database did
not already exist, it is created and an event handler creates the
object store and indexes. Finally, the opened connection is saved for
use in subsequent examples.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
var request = indexedDB.open("library");

request.onupgradeneeded = function() {
  // The database did not previously exist, so create object stores and indexes.
  var db = request.result;
  var store = db.createObjectStore("books", {keyPath: "isbn"});
  var titleIndex = store.createIndex("by_title", "title", {unique: true});
  var authorIndex = store.createIndex("by_author", "author");

  // Populate with initial data.
  store.put({title: "Quarry Memories", author: "Fred", isbn: 123456});
  store.put({title: "Water Buffaloes", author: "Fred", isbn: 234567});
  store.put({title: "Bedrock Nights", author: "Barney", isbn: 345678});
};

request.onsuccess = function() {
  db = request.result;
};
</pre>

The following example populates the database using a transaction.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
var tx = db.transaction("books", "readwrite");
var store = tx.objectStore("books");

store.put({title: "Quarry Memories", author: "Fred", isbn: 123456});
store.put({title: "Water Buffaloes", author: "Fred", isbn: 234567});
store.put({title: "Bedrock Nights", author: "Barney", isbn: 345678});

tx.oncomplete = function() {
  // All requests have succeeded and the transaction has committed.
};
</pre>

The following example looks up a single book in the database by title
using an index.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
var tx = db.transaction("books", "readonly");
var store = tx.objectStore("books");
var index = store.index("by_title");

var request = index.get("Bedrock Nights");
request.onsuccess = function() {
  var matching = request.result;
  if (matching !== undefined) {
    // A match was found.
    report(matching.isbn, matching.title, matching.author);
  } else {
    // No match was found.
    report(null);
  }
};
</pre>

The following example looks up all books in the database by author
using an index and a cursor.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
var tx = db.transaction("books", "readonly");
var store = tx.objectStore("books");
var index = store.index("by_author");

var request = index.openCursor(IDBKeyRange.only("Fred"));
request.onsuccess = function() {
  var cursor = request.result;
  if (cursor) {
    // Called for each matching record.
    report(cursor.value.isbn, cursor.value.title, cursor.value.author);
    cursor.continue();
  } else {
    // No more matching records.
    report(null);
  }
};
</pre>

The following example shows how errors could be handled when a request
fails.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
var tx = db.transaction("books", "readwrite");
var store = tx.objectStore("books");
var request = store.put({title: "Water Buffaloes", author: "Slate", isbn: 987654});
request.onerror = function() {
  // The uniqueness constraint of the "by_title" index failed.
  report(request.error);
  // Could call request.preventDefault() to prevent the transaction from aborting.
};
tx.onabort = function() {
  // Otherwise the transaction will automatically abort due the failed request.
  report(tx.error);
};
</pre>

The database connection may be closed when it is no longer needed.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
db.close();
</pre>

In the future, the database may have grown to contain other object
stores and indexes. The following example shows one way to handle
opening an older version of the database.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
var request = indexedDB.open("library", 3); // Request version 3.

request.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
  var db = request.result;
  if (event.oldVersion &lt; 1) {
    // Version 1 is the first version of the database.
    var store = db.createObjectStore("books", {keyPath: "isbn"});
    var titleIndex = store.createIndex("by_title", "title", {unique: true});
    var authorIndex = store.createIndex("by_author", "author");
  }
  if (event.oldVersion &lt; 2) {
    // Version 2 introduces a new index of books by year.
    var bookStore = request.transaction.objectStore("books");
    var yearIndex = bookStore.createIndex("by_year", "year");
  }
  if (event.oldVersion &lt; 3) {
    // Version 3 introduces a new object store for magazines with two indexes.
    var magazines = db.createObjectStore("magazines");
    var publisherIndex = magazines.createIndex("by_publisher", "publisher");
    var frequencyIndex = magazines.createIndex("by_frequency", "frequency");
  }
};

request.onsuccess = function() {
  db = request.result; // db.version will be 3.
};
</pre>

A <dfn>sorted list</dfn> is a {{DOMStringList}} containing strings
sorted in ascending order using the algorithm defined by step 4 of
<cite>section 11.8.5, The Abstract Relational Comparison
Algorithm</cite> of the ECMAScript Language Specification
[[!ECMA-262]].

<h3 id=database-construct>Database</h4>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

A database's <a>origin</a> is the same as the <a>origin</a> of the
<a>document</a> or <a>worker</a>. Each <a>origin</a> has an associated
set of databases.

<aside class=note>
  The database origin is not affected by changes to
  the {{Document}}'s {{Document/domain}}.
</aside>

Each <a>origin</a> has an associated set of <a>databases</a>. A
<dfn>database</dfn> has zero or more <a for=/>object stores</a> which
hold the data stored in the database.

<div dfn-for=database>

A <a>database</a> has a <dfn>name</dfn> which identifies it within a
specific <a>origin</a>. The name can be any string value, including
the empty string, and stays constant for the lifetime of the database.
Database names are always compared in a case-sensitive manner, as
opaque sequences of 16-bit code units. Implementations must support
all names.

<aside class=note>
  If an implementation uses a storage mechanism which can't handle
  arbitrary database names, the implementation must use an escaping
  mechanism or something similar to map the provided name to a name that
  it can handle.
</aside>

A <a>database</a> has a <dfn>version</dfn>. When a database is first
created, its <a for=database>version</a> is 0 (zero).

<aside class=note>
  Each <a>database</a> has one version at a time; a <a>database</a>
  can't exist in multiple versions at once. The only way to change the
  version is using an <a>upgrade transaction</a>.
</aside>

A database has a <dfn>delete pending flag</dfn> which is used during
deletion. When a database is requested to be deleted the flag is set
and all attempts at opening the database are stalled until the
database can be deleted.

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h4 id=database-connection>Database Connection</h4>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Script does not interact with <a>databases</a> directly. Instead,
script has indirect access via a <dfn lt="connection|connected">connection</dfn>.
A <a for=/>connection</a> object can be used to manipulate the objects of
that <a>database</a>. It is also the only way to obtain a
<a for=/>transaction</a> for that <a>database</a>.

The act of opening a <a>database</a> creates a <a for=/>connection</a>.
There may be multiple <a for=/>connections</a> to a given <a>database</a> at
any given time.

<div dfn-for=connection>

A <a for=/>connection</a> has a <dfn>version</dfn>, which is set when
the <a for=/>connection</a> is created. It remains constant for the
lifetime of the <a for=/>connection</a> unless an <a data-lt="steps
for aborting an upgrade transaction">upgrade is aborted</a>, in which
case it is set to the previous version of the <a>database</a>. Once
the <a for=/>connection</a> is closed the <a
for=connection>version</a> does not change.

Each connection has a <dfn>close pending flag</dfn> which is initially
unset.

When a <a for=/>connection</a> is initially created it is in
<dfn>opened</dfn> state. The connection can be <dfn>closed</dfn>
through several means. If the execution context where the
<a for=/>connection</a> was created is destroyed (for example due to the
user navigating away from that page), the connection is closed. The
connection can also be closed explicitly using the <a>steps for
closing a database connection</a>. When the connection is closed the
<a>close pending flag</a> is always set if it hasn't already been.

A <a for=/>connection</a> may be closed by a user agent in exceptional
circumstances, for example due to loss of access to the file system or
a permission change. If this occurs the user agent must run the
<a>steps for closing a database connection</a> with the
<a for=/>connection</a> and with the |forced flag| set.

A <a for=/>connection</a> has an <dfn>object store set</dfn>, which is
initialized to the set of <a for=/>object stores</a> in the associated
<a>database</a> when the <a for=/>connection</a> is created. The
contents of the set will remain constant except when an <a>upgrade
transaction</a> is running.

A <a for=/>connection</a>'s <a>get the parent</a> algorithm returns
null.

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=object-store-construct>Object Store</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

An <dfn>object store</dfn> is the primary
storage mechanism for storing data in a <a>database</a>.

<div dfn-for=object-store>

Each database has a set of <a for=/>object stores</a>. The set of <a
for=/>object stores</a> can be changed, but only using an <a>upgrade
transaction</a>, i.e. in response to an <a>upgradeneeded</a> event.
When a new database is created it doesn't contain any <a for=/>object
stores</a>.

An <a for=/>object store</a> has a <dfn>list of records</dfn> which
hold the data stored in the object store. Each <dfn>record</dfn>
consists of a <a for=/>key</a> and a <a for=/>value</a>. The list is
sorted according to key in ascending order. There can never be
multiple records in a given object store with the same key.

An <a for=/>object store</a> has a <dfn>name</dfn>. The name can be
any string value, including the empty string. At any one time, the
name is unique within the <a>database</a> to which it belongs. Object
store names are always compared in a case-sensitive manner, as opaque
sequences of 16-bit code units.

An <a for=/>object store</a> optionally has a <dfn>key path</dfn>. If
the object store has a key path it is said to use <dfn>in-line
keys</dfn>. Otherwise it is said to use <dfn>out-of-line keys</dfn>.

An <a for=/>object store</a> optionally has a <a>key generator</a>.

An object store can derive a <a for=/>key</a> for a <a>record</a> from
one of three sources:

1. A <a>key generator</a>. A key generator generates a monotonically
    increasing numbers every time a key is needed.

2. Keys can be derived via a <a for=object-store>key path</a>.

3. Keys can also be explicitly specified when a <a for=/>value</a> is stored
    in the object store.

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h4 id=object-store-handle-construct>Object Store Handle</h4>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Script does not interact with <a for=/>object stores</a> directly.
Instead, within a <a for=/>transaction</a>, script has indirect access
via an <dfn>object store handle</dfn>.

<div dfn-for=object-store-handle>

An <a for=/>object store handle</a> has an associated <dfn>object
store</dfn> and an associated <dfn>transaction</dfn>. Multiple handles
may be associated with the same <a for=/>object store</a> in different
<a for=/>transactions</a>, but there must be only one <a for=/>object
store handle</a> associated with a particular <a for=/>object
store</a> within a <a for=/>transaction</a>.

An <a for=/>object store handle</a> has an <dfn>index set</dfn>, which
is initialized to the set of <a for=/>indexes</a> that reference the
associated <a for=object-store-handle>object store</a> when the <a
for=/>object store handle</a> is created. The contents of the set will
remain constant except when an <a>upgrade transaction</a> is running.

An <a for=/>object store handle</a> has a <dfn>name</dfn>, which is
initialized to the <a for=object-store>name</a> of the associated <a
for=object-store-handle>object store</a> when the <a for=/>object
store handle</a> is created. The name will remain constant except when
an <a>upgrade transaction</a> is running.

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=value-construct>Values</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Each record is associated with a <dfn>value</dfn>.
User agents must support any ECMAScript [[!ECMA-262]] value supported
by the <a>structured clone algorithm</a> [[!HTML]]. This includes
simple types such as <a>String</a> primitive values and <a>Date</a>
objects as well as <a>Object</a> and <a>Array</a> instances, {{File}}
objects, {{Blob}} objects, {{ImageData}} objects, and so on. Record
<a for=/>values</a> are stored and retrieved by value rather than by
reference; later changes to a value have no effect on the record
stored in the database.


<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=key-construct>Keys</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

In order to efficiently retrieve <a>records</a> stored in an indexed
database, each <a>record</a> is organized according to its
<dfn>key</dfn>.

<div dfn-for=key>

A <a for=/>key</a> has an associated <dfn>type</dfn> which is one of:
<i>number</i>,
<i>date</i>,
<i>string</i>,
<i>binary</i>,
or
<i>array</i>.

<aside class=advisement>
  &#x2660; Support for <i>binary</i> keys is new in this edition, but
  not yet shipping in any browsers. &#x2660;
</aside>

A <a for=/>key</a> also has an associated <dfn>value</dfn>, which will
be either:
an {{unrestricted double}} if type is <i>number</i> or <i>date</i>,
a {{DOMString}} if type is <i>string</i>,
a list of <a>octets</a> if type is <i>binary</i>,
or a list of other <a for=/>keys</a> if type is <i>array</i>.

</div>

An ECMAScript [[!ECMA-262]] value can be converted to a <a for=/>key</a> by
following the steps to <a>convert a value to a key</a>.

<aside class=note>
  The following ECMAScript types are valid keys:

  * <a>Number</a> primitive values, except NaN. This includes Infinity
      and -Infinity.
  * <a>Date</a> objects, except where the [<span>[</span>DateValue]]
      internal slot is NaN
  * <a>String</a> primitive values.
  * <a>ArrayBuffer</a> objects (or views on buffers such as
      <a>Uint8Array</a>).
  * <a>Array</a> objects, where every item is defined, is itself a valid
      key, and does not directly or indirectly contain itself. This
      includes empty arrays. Arrays may contain other arrays.

  Attempting to convert other ECMAScript values to a <a for=/>key</a>
  will fail.
</aside>

An <dfn>array key</dfn> is a <a for=/>key</a> with <a
for=key>type</a> <i>array</i>. The <dfn>subkeys</dfn> of an
<a>array key</a> are the members of the <a>array key</a>'s <a
for=key>value</a> list.

To <dfn>compare two keys</dfn> |a| and |b|, run these steps:

<div class=algorithm>

1. Let |ta| be the <a for=key>type</a> of |a|.

2. Let |tb| be the <a for=key>type</a> of |b|.

3. If |ta| is <i>array</i> and |tb| is
    <i>binary</i>, <i>string</i>, <i>date</i> or <i>number</i>,
    return 1.
4. If |tb| is <i>array</i> and |ta| is
    <i>binary</i>, <i>string</i>, <i>date</i> or <i>number</i>,
    return -1.

5. If |ta| is <i>binary</i> and |tb| is
    <i>string</i>, <i>date</i> or <i>number</i>,
    return 1.
6. If |tb| is <i>binary</i> and |ta| is
    <i>string</i>, <i>date</i> or <i>number</i>,
    return -1.

7. If |ta| is <i>string</i> and |tb| is
    <i>date</i> or <i>number</i>,
    return 1.
8. If |tb| is <i>string</i> and |ta| is
    <i>date</i> or <i>number</i>,
    return -1.

9. If |ta| is <i>date</i> and |tb| is
    <i>number</i>,
    return 1.
10. If |tb| is <i>date</i> and |ta| is
    <i>number</i>,
    return -1.

11. Assert: |ta| and |tb| are equal.

12. Let |va| be the <a for=key>value</a> of |a|.
13. Let |vb| be the <a for=key>value</a> of |b|.

14. Switch on |ta|:

      <dd>
        1. If |va| is greater than |vb|, then return 1.

        1. Let |length| be the lesser of |va|'s length and |vb|'s length.

<h3 id=index-construct>Index</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

It is sometimes useful to retrieve <a>records</a> in an <a
for=/>object store</a> through other means than their <a
for=/>key</a>. An <dfn id=index-concept>index</dfn> allows looking up
<a>records</a> in an <a for=/>object store</a> using properties of the
<a for=/>values</a> in the <a for=/>object stores</a> <a>records</a>.

<div dfn-for=index>

An index is a specialized persistent key-value storage and has a
<dfn>referenced</dfn> <a for=/>object store</a>. The index has a
<dfn>list of records</dfn> which hold the data stored in the index.
The records in an index are automatically populated whenever records
in the <a>referenced</a> object store are inserted, updated or
deleted. There can be several <a for=/>indexes</a> referencing the
same <a for=/>object store</a>, in which changes to the object store
cause all such indexes to get updated.

The values in the index's <a>records</a> are always values of <a
for=/>keys</a> in the index's <a>referenced</a> object store. The keys
are derived from the referenced object store's <a for=/>values</a>
using a <dfn>key path</dfn>. If a given <a>record</a> with key |X| in
the object store referenced by the index has the value |A|, and <a
data-lt="extract a key from a value using a key path">evaluating</a>
the index's <a for=index>key path</a> on |A| yields the result |Y|,
then the index will contain a record with key |Y| and value |X|.

<aside class=example>
  For example, if an index's <a>referenced</a> object store contains a
  record with the key <code>123</code> and the value <code>{ first:
  "Alice", last: "Smith" }</code>, and the index's <a for=index>key
  path</a> is "<code>first</code>" then the index would contain a
  record with the key "<code>Alice</code>" and the value
  <code>123</code>.
</aside>

Records in an index are said to have a <dfn>referenced value</dfn>.
This is the value of the record in the index's referenced object store
which has a key equal to the index's record's value. So in the example
above, the record in the index whose key is |Y| and value is
|X| has a <a>referenced value</a> of |A|.

<aside class=example>
  In the preceding example, the record in the index with key
  "<code>Alice</code>" and value <code>123</code> would have a
  <a>referenced value</a> of <code>{ first: "Alice", last: "Smith"
  }</code>.
</aside>

<aside class=note>
Each record in an index references one and only one record in the
index's <a>referenced</a> object store. However there can be multiple
records in an index which reference the same record in the object
store. And there can also be no records in an index which reference a
given record in an object store.
</aside>

The <a>records</a> in an index are always sorted according to the
<a>record</a>'s key. However unlike object stores, a given index can
contain multiple records with the same key. Such records are
additionally sorted according to the <a for=/>index</a>'s <a>record</a>'s
value (meaning the key of the record in the referenced <a for=/>object
store</a>).

An <a for=/>index</a> has a <dfn>name</dfn>. The name can be any
string value, including the empty string. At any one time, the name is
unique within index's <a>referenced</a> <a for=/>object store</a>.
Index names are always compared in a case-sensitive manner, as opaque
sequences of 16-bit code units.

An <a for=/>index</a> has a <dfn>unique flag</dfn>. When this flag is
set, the index enforces that no two <a>records</a> in the index has
the same key. If a <a>record</a> in the index's referenced object
store is attempted to be inserted or modified such that evaluating the
index's key path on the records new value yields a result which
already exists in the index, then the attempted modification to the
object store fails.

An <a for=/>index</a> has a <dfn>multiEntry flag</dfn>. This flag
affects how the index behaves when the result of evaluating the
index's <a for=index>key path</a> yields an <a>array key</a>. If the
<a>multiEntry flag</a> is unset, then a single <a>record</a> whose <a
for=/>key</a> is an <a>array key</a> is added to the index. If the
<a>multiEntry flag</a> is true, then the one <a>record</a> is added to
the index for each of the <a>subkeys</a>.

<h4 id=index-handle-construct>Index Handle</h4>

Script does not interact with <a for=/>indexes</a> directly. Instead, within
a <a for=/>transaction</a>, script has indirect access via an <dfn>index
handle</dfn>.

<div dfn-for=index-handle>

An <a>index handle</a> has an associated <dfn>index</dfn> and an
associated <dfn>object store handle</dfn>. The <dfn>transaction</dfn>
of an <a>index handle</a> is the <a

but there must be only one <a>index handle</a> associated with a
particular <a for=/>index</a> within a <a for=/>transaction</a>.

An <a>index handle</a> has a <dfn>name</dfn>, which is initialized to
the <a for=index>name</a> of the associated <a

The name will remain constant except when an <a>upgrade

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=transaction-construct>Transactions</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

A <dfn id=transaction-concept>Transaction</dfn> is used to interact
with the data in a <a>database</a>. Whenever data is read or written
to the database it is done by using a <a for=/>transaction</a>.

<div dfn-for=transaction>

<a for=/>Transactions</a> offer some protection from application and system
failures. A <a for=/>transaction</a> may be used to store multiple data
records or to conditionally modify certain data records. A
<a for=/>transaction</a> represents an atomic and durable set of data access
and data mutation operations.

All transactions are created through a <a for=/>connection</a>, which is the
transaction's <dfn>connection</dfn>.

A <a for=/>transaction</a> has a <dfn>scope</dfn> that
determines the <a for=/>object stores</a> with which the transaction may
interact. A transaction's scope remains fixed for the lifetime of that
transaction.

A <a for=/>transaction</a> has a <dfn>mode</dfn> that
determines which types of interactions can be performed upon that
transaction. The <a>mode</a> is set when the transaction is created
and remains fixed for the life of the transaction. A
<a for=/>transaction</a>'s <a>mode</a> is one of the following:

<dl>
  <dt>{{"readonly"}}</dt>
  <dd>
    The transaction is only allowed to read data. No modifications can
    be done by this type of transaction. This has the advantage that
    several <a>read-only transactions</a> can run at the same time
    even if their <a>scopes</a> are overlapping, i.e. if they are
    using the same object stores. This type of transaction can be
    created any time once a database has been opened.
  </dd>

  <dt>{{"readwrite"}}</dt>
  <dd>
    The transaction is allowed to read, modify and delete data from
    existing object stores. However object stores and indexes can't be
    added or removed. Multiple {{"readwrite"}} transactions
    can't run at the same time if their <a>scopes</a> are overlapping
    since that would mean that they can modify each other's data in
    the middle of the transaction. This type of transaction can be
    created any time once a database has been opened.
  </dd>

  <dt>{{"versionchange"}}</dt>
  <dd>
    The transaction is allowed to read, modify and delete data from
    existing object stores, and can also create and remove object
    stores and indexes. It is the only type of transaction that can do
    so. This type of transaction can't be manually created, but
    instead is created automatically when an <a>upgradeneeded</a>
    event is fired.
  </dd>
</dl>

A <a for=/>transaction</a> has an <dfn>active flag</dfn>, which determines
if new <a>requests</a> can be made against the transaction. A
transaction is said to be <dfn>active</dfn> if its <a>active flag</a>
is set.

A <a for=/>transaction</a> has a <dfn>request list</dfn> of <a>requests</a>
which have been made against the transaction.

A <a for=/>transaction</a> has a <dfn>error</dfn> which is set if the
<a for=/>transaction</a> is <a>aborted</a>.

A <a for=/>transaction</a>'s <a>get the parent</a> algorithm returns the
transaction's <a for=transaction>connection</a>.

A <dfn>read-only transaction</dfn> is
a <a for=/>transaction</a> with <a>mode</a> {{"readonly"}}.

A <dfn>read/write transaction</dfn>
is a <a for=/>transaction</a> with <a>mode</a> {{"readwrite"}}.


<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h4 id=transaction-lifetime-concept>Transaction Lifetime</h4>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Transactions are expected to be short lived. This is encouraged by the
<a for=transaction lt=commit>automatic committing</a> functionality
described below.

<aside class=note>
  Authors can still cause transactions to run for a long time; however,
  this usage pattern is not generally recommended as it can lead to a
  bad user experience.
</aside>

The <dfn>lifetime</dfn> of a
<a for=/>transaction</a> is as follows:

1. A transaction is <dfn>created</dfn> with a <a>scope</a> and a <a>mode</a>.
    When a transaction is created its <a>active flag</a> is initially set.

2. The implementation must allow <a>requests</a> to be <a
    for=request>placed</a> against the transaction
    whenever the <a>active flag</a> is set. This is the case even if
    the transaction has not yet been <a>started</a>. Until the transaction is <a>started</a> the implementation must
    not execute these requests; however, the implementation must keep
    track of the <a>requests</a> and their order. Requests may be
    placed against a transaction only while that transaction is
    <a>active</a>. If an attempt is made to place a request against a
    transaction when that transaction is not <a>active</a>, the
    implementation must reject the attempt by throwing a
    {{TransactionInactiveError}}.

3. Once an implementation is able to enforce the constraints defined
    for the transaction <a>scope</a> and <a>mode</a>, defined below,
    the implementation must <a>queue a task</a> to <dfn lt="start|started">start</dfn> the transaction
    asynchronously.

4. Once the transaction has been <a>started</a> the implementation can start executing the
    <a>requests</a> placed against the transaction. Unless otherwise
    defined, requests must be executed in the order in which they were
    made against the transaction. Likewise, their results must be
    returned in the order the requests were placed against a specific
    transaction. There is no guarantee about the order that results
    from requests in different transactions are returned. Similarly,
    the transaction <a>modes</a> ensure that two requests placed
    against different transactions can execute in any order without
    affecting what resulting data is stored in the database.

5. A transaction can be <dfn lt="abort|aborting|aborted">aborted</dfn>
    at any time before it is <a>finished</a>, even if the transaction isn't currently
    <a>active</a> or hasn't yet <a>started</a>. When a transaction is aborted the
    implementation must undo (roll back) any changes that were made to
    the <a>database</a> during that transaction. This includes both
    changes to the contents of <a for=/>object stores</a> as well as
    additions and removals of <a for=/>object stores</a> and <a for=/>indexes</a>.

6. A transaction can fail for reasons not tied to a particular
    <a>request</a>. For example due to IO errors when committing the
    transaction, or due to running into a quota limit where the
    implementation can't tie exceeding the quota to a partcular
    request. In this case the implementation must run the <a>steps for
    aborting a transaction</a> using the transaction as
    |transaction| and the appropriate error type as
    |error|. For example if quota was exceeded then
    {{QuotaExceededError}} should be used as |error|, and
    if an IO error happened, {{UnknownError}} should be used as
    |error|.

7. When a transaction has been started and it can no longer become
    <a>active</a>, the implementation must attempt to <dfn
    lt="commit|committing|committed">commit</dfn> it, as long as the
    transaction has not been <a>aborted</a>. This usually happens
    after all requests placed against the transaction have been
    executed and their returned results handled, and no new requests
    have been placed against the transaction. When a transaction is
    committed, the implementation must atomically write any changes to
    the <a>database</a> made by requests placed against the
    transaction. That is, either all of the changes must be written,
    or if an error occurs, such as a disk write error, the
    implementation must not write any of the changes to the database.
    If such an error occurs, the implementation must <a>abort</a> the
    transaction by following the <a>steps for aborting a
    transaction</a>, otherwise it must <a for=transaction>commit</a>
    the transaction by following the <a>steps for committing a
    transaction</a>.

8. When a transaction is <a for=transaction>committed</a>
    or <a>aborted</a>, it is said to be
    <dfn lt="finish|finished">finished</dfn>. If a transaction
    can't be finished, for example due to the implementation crashing
    or the user taking some explicit action to cancel it, the
    implementation must <a>abort</a> the
    transaction.

The following constraints define when a <a for=/>transaction</a> can be <a>started</a>:

* Any number of <a>read-only transactions</a> are allowed to run
    concurrently, even if the transaction's <a>scope</a> overlap and
    include the same <a for=/>object stores</a>. As long as a <a>read-only
    transaction</a> is running, the data that the implementation
    returns through <a>requests</a> created with that transaction must
    remain constant. That is, two requests to read the same piece of
    data must yield the same result both for the case when data is
    found and the result is that data, and for the case when data is
    not found and a lack of data is indicated.

    <aside class=note>
      There are a number of ways that an implementation can ensure
      this. The implementation could prevent any <a>read/write
      transaction</a>, whose scope overlaps the scope of the
      <a>read-only transaction</a>, from starting until the
      <a>read-only transaction</a> finishes. Or the implementation
      could allow the <a>read-only transaction</a> to see a snapshot
      of the contents of the <a for=/>object stores</a> which is taken when
      the <a>read-only transaction</a> started.
    </aside>

* Similarly, implementations must ensure that a <a>read/write
    transaction</a> is only affected by changes to <a for=/>object
    stores</a> that are made using the transaction itself. For
    example, the implementation must ensure that another transaction
    does not modify the contents of <a for=/>object stores</a> in the
    <a>read/write transaction</a>'s <a>scope</a>. The implementation
    must also ensure that if the <a>read/write transaction</a>
    completes successfully, the changes written to <a for=/>object
    stores</a> using the transaction can be committed to the
    <a>database</a> without merge conflicts. An implementation must
    not abort a transaction due to merge conflicts.

* If multiple <a>read/write transactions</a> are attempting to access
    the same object store (i.e. if they have overlapping
    <a>scope</a>), the transaction that was <a>created</a> first must be the transaction which gets
    access to the object store first. Due to the requirements in the
    previous paragraph, this also means that it is the only
    transaction which has access to the object store until the
    transaction is <a>finished</a>.

* Any transaction <a>created</a> after a
    <a>read/write transaction</a> must see the changes written by the
    <a>read/write transaction</a>. So if a <a>read/write
    transaction</a>, A, is created, and later another transaction B,
    is created, and the two transactions have overlapping
    <a>scopes</a>, then B must see any changes made to any <a for=/>object
    stores</a> that are part of that overlapping <a>scope</a>. Due to
    the requirements in the previous paragraph, this also means that
    the B transaction does not have access to any <a for=/>object stores</a>
    in that overlapping <a>scope</a> until the A transaction is <a>finished</a>.

    <aside class=note>
      Generally speaking, the above requirements mean that any
      transaction which has an overlapping scope with a <a>read/write
      transaction</a> and which was created after that <a>read/write
      transaction</a>, can't run in parallel with that <a>read/write
      transaction</a>.
    </aside>

* User agents must ensure a reasonable level of fairness across
    transactions to prevent starvation. For example, if multiple
    <a>read-only transactions</a> are started one after another the
    implementation must not indefinitely prevent a pending
    <a>read/write transaction</a> from <a>starting</a>.

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h4 id=upgrade-transaction-construct>Upgrade Transactions</h4>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

An <dfn>upgrade transaction</dfn> is a
<a for=/>transaction</a> with <a>mode</a> {{"versionchange"}}.

An <a>upgrade transaction</a> is automatically created when running
<a>steps for running an upgrade transaction</a> after a
<a for=/>connection</a> is opened to a <a>database</a> giving a greater <a
for=database>version</a> than the current <a for=database>version</a>.
This <a for=/>transaction</a> will be active inside the <a>upgradeneeded</a>
event handler, allowing the creation of new <a for=/>object stores</a> and
<a for=/>indexes</a>.

An <a>upgrade transaction</a> is never run concurrently with other
transactions. When a database is opened with a <a
for=database>version</a> number higher than the current <a
for=database>version</a>, a new <a>upgrade transaction</a> is
automatically created and made available through the <a>open
request</a> when the <a>upgradeneeded</a> event is fired. The
<a>upgradeneeded</a> event isn't fired, and thus the <a>upgrade
transaction</a> isn't started, until all other <a for=/>connections</a> to
the same <a>database</a> are closed. This ensures that all other
transactions are <a>finished</a>.

As long as an <a>upgrade transaction</a> is running, attempts to open
more <a for=/>connections</a> to the same <a>database</a> are delayed, and
any attempts to use the same <a for=/>connection</a> to start additional
transactions will result in an exception being thrown. Thus <a>upgrade
transactions</a> not only ensure that no other transactions are
running concurrently, but also ensure that no other transactions are
queued against the same <a>database</a> as long as the transaction is
running.


<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=request-construct>Requests</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Each asynchronous operation on a <a>database</a> is done using a <dfn>request</dfn>. Every request represents one
operation.

<div dfn-for=request>

A <a>request</a> has a <dfn>done flag</dfn> which is initially unset.

A <a>request</a> has a <dfn>source</dfn> object.

A <a>request</a> has a <dfn>result</dfn> and
an <dfn>error</dfn>, neither
of which are accessible until the <a>done flag</a> is set.

A <a>request</a> has a <dfn>transaction</dfn> which is initially
null. This will be set when a request is <dfn>placed</dfn> against a <a for=/>transaction</a> using the <a>steps
for asynchronously executing a request</a>.

When a request is made, a new <a>request</a> is returned with its
<a>done flag</a> unset. If a request completes successfully, the
<a>done flag</a> is set, the <a for=request>result</a> is
set to the result of the request, and an event with type
<code>success</code> is fired at the <a>request</a>.

If an error occurs while performing the operation, the <a>done
flag</a> is set, the <a for=request>error</a> is set to
the error, and an event with type <code>error</code> is fired at the
request.

A <a>request</a>'s <a>get the parent</a> algorithm
returns the request's <a for=request>transaction</a>.

An <dfn>open request</dfn> is a special type of <a>request</a> used
when opening a <a for=/>connection</a> or deleting a <a>database</a>. In
addition to <code>success</code> and <code>error</code> events,
<a>blocked</a> and <a>upgradeneeded</a> may be fired at an <a>open
request</a> to indicate progress.

The <a for=request>source</a> of an <a>open request</a>
is always null.

The <a for=request>transaction</a> of an <a>open
request</a> is null unless an <a>upgradeneeded</a> event has been
fired.

An <a>open request</a>'s <a>get the parent</a> algorithm returns null.

<aside class=note>
  Requests are not typically re-used, but there are exceptions. When a
  <a>cursor</a> is iterated, the success of the iteration is reported
  on the same <a>request</a> object used to open the cursor. And when
  an <a>upgrade transaction</a> is necessary, the same <a>open
  request</a> is used for both the <a>upgradeneeded</a> event and
  final result of the open operation itself. In both cases, the
  request's <a>done flag</a> will be unset then set again, and the <a
  for=request>result</a> may change.

<h3 id=range-construct>Key Range</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

Records can be retrieved from <a for=/>object stores</a> and <a for=/>indexes</a>
using either <a for=/>keys</a> or <a>key ranges</a>. A <dfn>key range</dfn> is a continuous interval over some data type
used for keys.

A <a>key range</a> has an associated <dfn>lower bound</dfn> (null or a
<a for=/>key</a>).

A <a>key range</a> has an associated <dfn>upper bound</dfn> (null or a
<a for=/>key</a>).

A <a>key range</a> has an associated <dfn>lower open flag</dfn>.
Unless otherwise stated it is unset.

A <a>key range</a> has an associated <dfn>upper open flag</dfn>.
Unless otherwise stated it is unset.

A <a>key range</a> may have a <a>lower bound</a> <a>equal to</a> its
<a>upper bound</a>. A <a>key range</a> must not have a <a>lower
bound</a> <a>greater than</a> its <a>upper bound</a>.

A <a>key range</a> <dfn>containing only</dfn> |key| has both
<a>lower bound</a> and <a>upper bound</a> equal to |key|.

A |key| is <dfn>in a key range</dfn> if both of the following
conditions are fulfilled:

* The <a>lower bound</a> is null, or it is <a>less than</a>
    |key|, or it is both <a>equal to</a> |key| and
    the <a>lower open flag</a> is unset.

* The <a>upper bound</a> is null, or it is <a>greater than</a>
    |key|, or it is both <a>equal to</a> |key| and
    the <a>upper open flag</a> is unset.

<aside class=note>

  * If the <a>lower open flag</a> of a <a>key range</a> is unset, the
    <a>lower bound</a> <a for=/>key</a> of the <a>key range</a> is included

<h3 id=cursor-construct>Cursor</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

A <dfn>cursor</dfn> is used to iterate over a range of records in an
<a for=/>index</a> or an <a for=/>object store</a> in a specific direction.

<div dfn-for=cursor>

A <a>cursor</a> has a <dfn>transaction</dfn>, the <a for=/>transaction</a>
that was <a>active</a> when the cursor was created.

A <a>cursor</a> has a <dfn>range</dfn> of records in either an
<a for=/>index</a> or an <a for=/>object store</a>.

A <a>cursor</a> has a <dfn>source</dfn> that indicates which <a for=/>index</a>
or an <a for=/>object store</a> is associated with the records over which
the <a>cursor</a> is iterating.

A <a>cursor</a> has a <dfn>direction</dfn> that determines whether it
moves in monotonically increasing or decreasing order of the
<a>record</a> keys when iterated, and if it skips duplicated values
when iterating indexes. The direction of a cursor also determines if
the cursor initial position is at the start of its <a
for=cursor>source</a> or at its end. A cursor's
<a>direction</a> is one of the following:

<dl>
  <dt>{{"next"}}</dt>
  <dd>
    This direction causes the cursor to be opened at the start of the
    <a for=cursor>source</a>. When iterated, the
    <a>cursor</a> should yield all records, including duplicates, in
    monotonically increasing order of keys.
  </dd>

  <dt>{{"nextunique"}}</dt>
  <dd>
    This direction causes the cursor to be opened at the start of the
    <a for=cursor>source</a>. When iterated, the <a>cursor</a> should
    not yield records with the same key, but otherwise yield all
    records, in monotonically increasing order of keys. For every key
    with duplicate values, only the first record is yielded. When the
    <a for=cursor>source</a> is an <a for=/>object store</a> or an <a
    for=/>index</a> with the <a>unique flag</a> set, this direction
    has exactly the same behavior as {{"next"}}.
  </dd>

  <dt>{{"prev"}}</dt>
  <dd>
    This direction causes the cursor to be opened at the end of the <a
    for=cursor>source</a>. When iterated, the
    <a>cursor</a> should yield all records, including duplicates, in
    monotonically decreasing order of keys.
  </dd>

  <dt>{{"prevunique"}}</dt>
  <dd>
    This direction causes the cursor to be opened at the end of the <a
    for=cursor>source</a>. When iterated, the <a>cursor</a> should not
    yield records with the same key, but otherwise yield all records,
    in monotonically decreasing order of keys. For every key with
    duplicate values, only the first record is yielded. When the <a
    for=cursor>source</a> is an <a for=/>object store</a> or an <a
    for=/>index</a> with the <a>unique flag</a> set, this direction
    has exactly the same behavior as {{"prev"}}.
  </dd>
</dl>

A <a>cursor</a> has a <dfn>position</dfn> within its range. It is
possible for the list of records which the cursor is iterating over to
change before the full <a>range</a> of the cursor has been iterated.
In order to handle this, cursors maintain their <a>position</a> not as
an index, but rather as a <a for=/>key</a> of the previously returned
record. For a forward iterating cursor, the next time the cursor is
asked to iterate to the next record it returns the record with the
lowest <a for=/>key</a> <a>greater than</a> the one previously
returned. For a backwards iterating cursor, the situation is opposite
and it returns the record with the highest <a for=/>key</a> <a>less
than</a> the one previously returned.

For cursors iterating indexes the situation is a little bit more
complicated since multiple records can have the same key and are
therefore also sorted by <a for=/>value</a>. When iterating indexes the
<a>cursor</a> also has an <dfn>object store position</dfn>, which
indicates the <a for=/>value</a> of the previously found <a>record</a> in
the index. Both <a>position</a> and the <a>object store position</a>
are used when finding the next appropriate record.

A <a>cursor</a> has a <dfn>key</dfn> and a <dfn>value</dfn> which
represent the <a for=/>key</a> and the <a for=/>value</a> of the last
iterated <a>record</a>.

A <a>cursor</a> has a <dfn>got value flag</dfn>. When this flag unset,
the cursor is either in the process of loading the next value or it
has reached the end of its <a>range</a>. When it is set, it indicates
that the cursor is currently holding a value and that it is ready to
iterate to the next one.

If the <a for=cursor>source</a> of a cursor is an <a for=/>object
store</a>, the <dfn>effective object store</dfn> of the cursor is that
object store and the <dfn>effective key</dfn> of the cursor is the
cursor's <a>position</a>. If the <a for=cursor>source</a> of a cursor
is an <a for=/>index</a>, the <a>effective object store</a> of the
cursor is that index's <a>referenced</a> object store and the
<a>effective key</a> is the cursor's <a>object store position</a>.

A <a>cursor</a> also has a <dfn>key only flag</dfn>, that indicates
whether the cursor's <a for=cursor>value</a> is exposed
via the API. Unless stated otherwise it is unset.

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=key-generator-construct>Key Generators</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

When a <a for=/>object store</a> is created it can be specified to use
a <dfn>key generator</dfn>. A <a>key generator</a> keeps an internal
<dfn>current number</dfn>. The <a>current number</a> is always a
positive integer. Whenever the key generator is used to generate a new
<a for=/>key</a>, the generator's <a>current number</a> is returned
and <strong>then</strong> incremented to prepare for the next time a
new <a for=/>key</a> is needed. Implementations must use the following
rules for generating numbers when a <a>key generator</a> is used.

* Every object store that uses key generators use a separate
    generator. I.e. interacting with one object store never affects
    the key generator of any other object store.

* The <a>current number</a> of a <a>key generator</a> is always set to
    1 when the <a for=/>object store</a> for that key generator is first
    created.

* When a key generator is used to generate a new <a for=/>key</a> for
    a <a for=/>object store</a>, the key generator's <a>current
    number</a> is used as the new key value and then the key
    generator's <a>current number</a> is increased by 1.

* When a <a>record</a> is stored and a <a for=/>key</a> is specified
    in the call to store the record, if <a for=key>type</a> of the key
    is <i>number</i> and the <a for=key>value</a> is greater than or
    equal to the key generator's <a>current number</a>, then the key
    generator's <a>current number</a> is set to the smallest integer
    number <a>greater than</a> the explicit key. A key can be
    specified both for object stores which use <a>in-line keys</a>, by
    setting the property on the stored value which the object store's
    <a for=object-store>key path</a> points to, and for object stores
    which use <a>out-of-line keys</a>, by passing a key argument to
    the call to store the <a>record</a>.

    <aside class=note>
      Only specified keys of <a for=key>type</a>
      <i>number</i> may affect the <a>current number</a> of the key
      generator. Keys of <a for=key>type</a> <i>date</i>,
      <i>array</i> (regardless of the other keys they contain),
      <i>binary</i>, or <i>string</i> (regardless of whether they
      could be parsed as numbers) have no effect on the <a>current
      number</a> of the key generator. Keys of <a
      for=key>type</a> <i>number</i> with <a
      for=key>value</a> less than 1 do not affect the
      <a>current number</a> since they are always lower than the
      <a>current number</a>.
    </aside>

* Modifying a key generator's <a>current number</a> is considered part
    of a database operation. This means that if the operation fails
    and the operation is reverted, the <a>current number</a> is
    reverted to the value it had before the operation started. This
    applies both to modifications that happen due to the <a>current
    number</a> getting increased by 1 when the key generator is used,
    and to modifications that happen due to a <a>record</a> being
    stored with a key value specified in the call to store the
    <a>record</a>.

* Likewise, if a <a for=/>transaction</a> is aborted, the <a>current
    number</a> of the key generator for each <a for=/>object store</a> in
    the transaction's <a>scope</a> is reverted to the value it had
    before the <a for=/>transaction</a> was started.

* When the <a>current number</a> of a key generator reaches above the
    value 2<sup>53</sup> (9007199254740992) any attempts to use the
    key generator to generate a new <a for=/>key</a> will result in a
    {{ConstraintError}}. It is still possible to insert
    <a>records</a> into the object store by specifying an explicit
    key, however the only way to use a key generator again for the
    object store is to delete the object store and create a new one.

    <aside class=note>
      As long as key generators are used in a normal fashion this will
      not be a problem. If you generate a new key 1000 times per
      second day and night, you won't run into this limit for over
      285000 years.
    </aside>

* The <a>current number</a> for a key generator never decreases, other
    than as a result of database operations being reverted. Deleting a
    <a>record</a> from an <a for=/>object store</a> never affects the
    object store's key generator. Even clearing all records from an
    object store, for example using the {{clear()}} method, does not
    affect the <a>current number</a> of the object store's key
    generator.

A practical result of this is that the first key generated for an
object store is always 1 (unless a higher numeric key is inserted
first) and the key generated for an object store is always a positive
integer higher than the highest numeric key in the store. The same key
is never generated twice for the same object store unless a
transaction is rolled back.

<aside class=example>

Each object store gets its own key generator:

<pre class=lang-javascript>
store1 = db.createObjectStore("store1", { autoIncrement: true });
store1.put("a"); // Will get key 1
store2 = db.createObjectStore("store2", { autoIncrement: true });
store2.put("a"); // Will get key 1
store1.put("b"); // Will get key 2
store2.put("b"); // Will get key 2
</pre>

If an insertion fails due to constraint violations or IO error, the
key generator is not updated.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
transaction.onerror = function(e) { e.preventDefault() };
store = db.createObjectStore("store1", { autoIncrement: true });
index = store.createIndex("index1", "ix", { unique: true });
store.put({ ix: "a"}); // Will get key 1
store.put({ ix: "a"}); // Will fail
store.put({ ix: "b"}); // Will get key 2
</pre>

Removing items from an objectStore never affects the key generator.
Including when {{clear()}} is called.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
store = db.createObjectStore("store1", { autoIncrement: true });
store.put("a"); // Will get key 1
store.delete(1);
store.put("b"); // Will get key 2
store.clear();
store.put("c"); // Will get key 3
store.delete(IDBKeyRange.lowerBound(0));
store.put("d"); // Will get key 4
</pre>

Inserting an item with an explicit key affects the key generator if,
and only if, the key is numeric and higher than the last generated
key.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
store = db.createObjectStore("store1", { autoIncrement: true });
store.put("a"); // Will get key 1
store.put("b", 3); // Will use key 3
store.put("c"); // Will get key 4
store.put("d", -10); // Will use key -10
store.put("e"); // Will get key 5
store.put("f", 6.00001); // Will use key 6.0001
store.put("g"); // Will get key 7
store.put("f", 8.9999); // Will use key 8.9999
store.put("g"); // Will get key 9
store.put("h", "foo"); // Will use key "foo"
store.put("i"); // Will get key 10
store.put("j", [1000]); // Will use key [1000]
store.put("k"); // Will get key 11
// All of these would behave the same if the objectStore used a
// keyPath and the explicit key was passed inline in the object
</pre>

Aborting a transaction rolls back any increases to the key generator
which happened during the transaction. This is to make all rollbacks
consistent since rollbacks that happen due to crash never has a chance
to commit the increased key generator value.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
db.createObjectStore("store", { autoIncrement: true });
trans1 = db.transaction(["store"], "readwrite");
store_t1 = trans1.objectStore("store");
store_t1.put("a"); // Will get key 1
store_t1.put("b"); // Will get key 2
trans1.abort();
trans2 = db.transaction(["store"], "readwrite");
store_t2 = trans2.objectStore("store");
store_t2.put("c"); // Will get key 1
store_t2.put("d"); // Will get key 2
</pre>
</aside>

<aside class=example>

The following examples illustrate the different behaviors when trying
to use in-line <a for=/>keys</a> and <a>key generators</a> to save an object
to an <a for=/>object store</a>.

If the following conditions are true:

* The <a for=/>object store</a> has a <a>key generator</a>.

* There is no in-line value for the <a for=object-store>key path</a>
    property.

Then the value provided by the <a>key generator</a> is used to
populate the key value. In the example below the <a
for=object-store>key path</a> for the object store is
"<code>foo.bar</code>". The actual object has no value for the
<code>bar</code> property, <code>{ foo: {} }</code>. When the object
is saved in the <a for=/>object store</a> the <code>bar</code>
property is assigned a value of 1 because that is the next <a
for=/>key</a> generated by the <a>key generator</a>.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
var store = db.createObjectStore("store", { keyPath: "foo.bar",
                                            autoIncrement: true });
store.put({ foo: {} }).onsuccess = function(e) {
  var key = e.target.result;
  console.assert(key === 1);
};
</pre>

If the following conditions are true:

* The <a for=/>object store</a> has a <a>key generator</a>.

* There is a value for the <a for=object-store>key path</a>
    property.

Then the value associated with the <a for=object-store>key path</a>
property is used. The auto-generated <a for=/>key</a> is not used. In the
example below the <a for=object-store>key path</a> for the <a for=/>object
store</a> is "<code>foo.bar</code>". The actual object has a value of
10 for the <code>bar</code> property, <code>{ foo: { bar: 10}
}</code>. When the object is saved in the <a for=/>object store</a> the
<code>bar</code> property keeps its value of 10, because that is the
key value.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
var store = db.createObjectStore("store", { keyPath: "foo.bar",
                                            autoIncrement: true });
store.put({ foo: { bar: 10 } }).onsuccess = function(e) {
  var key = e.target.result;
  console.assert(key === 10);
};
</pre>

The following example illustrates the scenario when the specified
in-line <a for=/>key</a> is defined through a <a for=object-store>key
path</a> but there is no property matching it. The value provided by
the <a>key generator</a> is then used to populate the key value and
the system is responsible for creating as many properties as it
requires to suffice the property dependencies on the hierarchy chain.
In the example below the <a for=object-store>key path</a> for the <a
for=/>object store</a> is "<code>foo.bar.baz</code>". The actual
object has no value for the <code>foo</code> property, <code>{ zip: {}
}</code>. When the object is saved in the <a for=/>object store</a>
the <code>foo</code>, <code>bar</code>, and <code>baz</code>
properties are created each as a child of the other until a value for
<code>foo.bar.baz</code> can be assigned. The value for
<code>foo.bar.baz</code> is the next key generated by the object
store.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
var store = db.createObjectStore("store", { keyPath: "foo.bar.baz",
                                            autoIncrement: true });
store.put({ zip: {} }).onsuccess = function(e) {
  var key = e.target.result;
  console.assert(key === 1);
  store.get(key).onsuccess = function(e) {
    var value = e.target.result;
    // value will be: { zip: {}, foo: { bar: { baz: 1 } } }
    console.assert(value.foo.bar.baz === 1);
  };
};
</pre>

Attempting to store a property on a primitive value will fail and
throw an error. In the first example below the <a for=object-store>key
path</a> for the object store is "<code>foo</code>". The actual object
is a primitive with the value, <code>4</code>. Trying to define a
property on that primitive value fails. The same is true for arrays.
Properties are not allowed on an array. In the second example below,
the actual object is an array, <code>[10]</code>. Trying to define a
property on the array fails.

<pre class=lang-javascript>
var store = db.createObjectStore("store", { keyPath: "foo", autoIncrement: true });

// The key generation will attempt to create and store the key path
// property on this primitive.
store.put(4); // will throw DataError

// The key generation will attempt to create and store the key path
// property on this array.
store.put([10]); // will throw DataError

<h2 id=async-api>API</h2>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

The API methods return without blocking the calling thread. All
asynchronous operations immediately return an {{IDBRequest}}
instance. This object does not initially contain any information about
the result of the operation. Once information becomes available, an
event is fired on the request and the information becomes available
through the properties of the {{IDBRequest}} instance.

The <span>task source</span> for these tasks is the <dfn>database
access task source</dfn>.


<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=request-api>The {{IDBRequest}} interface</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

The {{IDBRequest}} interface provides the means to access results of
asynchronous requests to <a>databases</a> and <a>database</a>
objects using <a>event handler IDL attributes</a> [[!HTML]].

Every method for making asynchronous requests returns an
{{IDBRequest}} object that communicates back to the requesting
application through events. This design means that any number of
requests can be active on any <a>database</a> at a time.

Various event handlers are registered for responding to various
situations.

for=request>error</a> of the request, or null if no error occurred.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBRequest>source</dfn> attribute's getter must
return the <a for=request>source</a> of the <a>request</a>, or null if
no <a for=request>source</a> is set.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBRequest>transaction</dfn> attribute's getter
must return the <a for=request>transaction</a> of the <a>request</a>.
This property can be null for certain requests, such as for
<a>request</a> returned from {{IDBFactory/open()}}.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBRequest>readyState</dfn> attribute's getter
must return {{"pending"}} if the <a>done flag</a> is unset, and
{{"done"}} otherwise.


The <dfn attribute for=IDBRequest>onsuccess</dfn> attribute is the
event handler for the <code>success</code> event.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBRequest>onerror</dfn> attribute is the event
handler for the <code>error</code> event.


Methods on {{IDBDatabase}} that return a <a>open request</a> use
an extended interface to allow listening to the
<a>blocked</a> event and <a>upgradeneeded</a> event.

<pre class=idl>
[Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
interface IDBOpenDBRequest : IDBRequest {
  // Event handlers:
  attribute EventHandler onblocked;
  attribute EventHandler onupgradeneeded;
};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=IDBOpenDBRequest>onblocked</dfn> attribute is
the event handler for the <a>blocked</a> event.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBOpenDBRequest>onupgradeneeded</dfn>
attribute is the event handler for the <a>upgradeneeded</a> event.


<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=events>Event interfaces</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

This specification fires events with the following custom interfaces:

<pre class=idl>
[Exposed=(Window,Worker),
 Constructor(DOMString type, optional IDBVersionChangeEventInit eventInitDict)]
interface IDBVersionChangeEvent : Event {
  readonly attribute unsigned long long  oldVersion;
  readonly attribute unsigned long long? newVersion;
};

dictionary IDBVersionChangeEventInit : EventInit {
  unsigned long long  oldVersion = 0;
  unsigned long long? newVersion = null;
};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=IDBVersionChangeEvent>oldVersion</dfn>
attribute getter returns the previous version of the database.


The <dfn attribute for=IDBVersionChangeEvent>newVersion</dfn>
attribute getter returns the new version of the database, or null if
the database is being deleted. See the <a>steps for running an upgrade
transaction</a>.

Events are constructed as defined in <a
href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#constructing-events">Constructing
events</a>, in [[!WHATWG-DOM]].

To <dfn>fire a version change event</dfn> named |e| at |target| given
|oldVersion| and |newVersion|, dispatch an event at |target|. The
event must use the {{IDBVersionChangeEvent}} interface with its
{{Event/type}} set to |e|, its {{IDBVersionChangeEvent/oldVersion}}
attribute set to |oldVersion|, and its
{{IDBVersionChangeEvent/newVersion}} attribute set to |newVersion|.
This event must not bubble or be cancelable.


<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=factory-interface>The {{IDBFactory}} interface</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

<a>Database</a> objects are accessed through methods on the
{{IDBFactory}} interface. A single object implementing this
interface is present in the global scope of environments that support
Indexed DB operations.

<pre class=idl>
[NoInterfaceObject]
interface IDBEnvironment {
  readonly attribute IDBFactory indexedDB;
};
Window implements IDBEnvironment;
WorkerGlobalScope implements IDBEnvironment;
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=IDBEnvironment>indexedDB</dfn> attribute
provides applications a mechanism for accessing capabilities of
indexed databases.

<pre class=idl>
[Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
interface IDBFactory {
  IDBOpenDBRequest open(DOMString name,
                        [EnforceRange] optional unsigned long long version);
  IDBOpenDBRequest deleteDatabase(DOMString name);

  short cmp(any first, any second);
};
</pre>


The <dfn method for=IDBFactory>open(|name|, |version|)</dfn> method,
when invoked, must run these steps:

<div class=algorithm>

1. If |version| is 0 (zero), <a>throw</a> a <a>TypeError</a>.

2. Let |request| be a new <a>open request</a>.

3. <a>Queue a task</a> to run these substeps:

    1. Let |result| be the result of running the <a>steps for
        opening a database</a>, with the origin of the
        {{IDBEnvironment}} used to access this {{IDBFactory}},
        |name|, |version| if given and undefined
        otherwise, and |request|.

        <aside class=note>
          If |version| is not given and a <a>database</a>
          with that name already exists, a connection will be opened
          without changing the <a for=database>version</a>. If
          |version| is not given and no <a>database</a> with
          that name exists, a new <a>database</a> will be created with
          <a for=database>version</a> equal to 1.
        </aside>

    2. If |result| is an error, set the <a
        for=request>error</a> of |request| to
        |result| and dispatch an event at |request|.
        The event must use the <a>Event</a> interface and set the
        {{Event/type}} attribute to "<code>error</code>". The event
        does bubble but is not cancelable.

    3. Otherwise, set the <a for=request>result</a> of
        |request| to |result| and dispatch an event
        at |request|. The event must use the <a>Event</a>
        interface and set the {{Event/type}} attribute to
        "<code>success</code>". The event does not bubble and is not
        cancelable. If the steps above resulted in an <a>upgrade
        transaction</a> being run, then firing the
        "<code>success</code>" event must be done after the <a>upgrade
        transaction</a> completes.

        <aside class=note>
          The last requirement is to ensure that in case another
          version upgrade is about to happen, the success event is
          fired on the connection first so that the script gets a
          chance to register a listener for the
          <code>versionchange</code> event.
        </aside>

        <aside class=note>
          The firing of "<code>success</code>" or "<code>error</code>"
          events do not follow the normal steps to <a>fire a success
          event</a> or <a>fire an error event</a> as there is no
          active transaction at the time when they fire.
        </aside>

4. Return a new {{IDBOpenDBRequest}} object for |request|.

</div>

The <dfn method for=IDBFactory>deleteDatabase(|name|)</dfn> method,
when invoked, must run these steps:

<div class=algorithm>

1. Let |request| be a new <a>open request</a>.

2. <a>Queue a task</a> to run these substeps:

    1. Let |result| be the result of running the <a>steps for
        deleting a database</a>, with the origin of the
        {{IDBEnvironment}} used to access this {{IDBFactory}},
        |name|, and |request|.

    2. If |result| is an error set the <a
        for=request>error</a> of |request| to
        |result| and dispatch an event at |request|.
        The event must use the <a>Event</a> interface and set the
        {{Event/type}} attribute to "<code>error</code>". The event
        does bubble but is not cancelable.

    3. Otherwise, set the <a for=request>result</a> of
        |request| to undefined and <a>fire a version change
        event</a> named <code>success</code> at <a>request</a> with
        |result| and null.

        <aside class=note>
          The firing of "<code>success</code>" or "<code>error</code>"
          events do not follow the normal steps to <a>fire a success
          event</a> or <a>fire an error event</a> as there is no
          active transaction at the time when they fire.
        </aside>

3. Return a new {{IDBOpenDBRequest}} object for |request|.

</div>

The <dfn method for=IDBFactory>cmp(|first|, |second|)</dfn> method,
when invoked, must run these steps:

<div class=algorithm>

1. Let |a| be the result of running the steps to <a>convert a
    value to a key</a> with |first|. Rethrow any exceptions.

2. If |a| is invalid, <a>throw</a> a {{DataError}}.

3. Let |b| be the result of running the steps to <a>convert a
    value to a key</a> with |second|. Rethrow any exceptions.

4. If |b| is invalid, <a>throw</a> a {{DataError}}.

5. Return the results of running the steps to <a>compare two keys</a>
    with |a| and |b|.

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->

</div>

This method creates and returns a new <a for=/>object store</a> with the
given name in the <a>connected</a> <a>database</a>.
Note that this method must only be called from within an <a>upgrade
transaction</a>.

This method synchronously modifies the
{{IDBDatabase/objectStoreNames}} property on the {{IDBDatabase}}
instance on which it was called.

In some implementations it is possible for the implementation to run
into problems after queuing a task to create the <a for=/>object
store</a> after the {{createObjectStore()}} method has returned. For
example in implementations where metadata about the newly created <a
for=/>object store</a> is inserted into the database asynchronously,
or where the implementation might need to ask the user for permission
for quota reasons. Such implementations must still create and return
an {{IDBObjectStore}} object, and once the implementation determines
that creating the <a for=/>object store</a> has failed, it must abort
the transaction using the <a>steps for aborting a transaction</a>
using the appropriate error. For example if creating the <a
for=/>object store</a> failed due to quota reasons,
{{QuotaExceededError}} must be used as error.


The <dfn method for=IDBDatabase>deleteObjectStore(|name|)</dfn>
method, when invoked, must run these steps:

    <a>throw</a> an {{InvalidStateError}} if none.

3. If |transaction| is not <a>active</a>, <a>throw</a> a

4. Let |store| be the <a for=/>object store</a> <a
    for=object-store>named</a> |name| in |database|,
    or <a>throw</a> a {{NotFoundError}} if none.

5. Remove |store| from this <a for=/>connection</a>'s <a>object
    store set</a>.

6. Destroy |store|.

This method destroys the <a for=/>object store</a> with the given name in
the <a>connected</a> <a>database</a>. Note that this
method must only be called from within an <a>upgrade transaction</a>.

This method synchronously modifies the
{{IDBDatabase/objectStoreNames}} property on the {{IDBDatabase}}
instance on which it was called.


The <dfn method for=IDBDatabase>transaction(|storeNames|,

<div class=algorithm>

1. If |mode| parameter is not {{"readonly"}} or {{"readwrite"}},
    <a>throw</a> a <a>TypeError</a>.

2. If this method is called on {{IDBDatabase}} object for which an
    <a>upgrade transaction</a> is still running, <a>throw</a> an
    {{InvalidStateError}}.

3. If this method is called on an {{IDBDatabase}} instance where the
    <a>close pending flag</a> is set, <a>throw</a> an
    {{InvalidStateError}}.

4. Let |scope| be the set of unique strings in |storeNames| if it is a
    sequence, or a set containing one string equal to |storeNames|
    otherwise.

5. If any string in |scope| is not the name of an <a for=/>object

8. When control is returned to the event loop, the implementation must
    unset the <a>active flag</a>.

    <aside class=issue>

</div>

This method creates and returns a new <a for=/>index</a> with the
given name in the <a for=/>object store</a>. Note that this method
must only be called from within an <a>upgrade transaction</a>.

The index that is requested to be created can contain constraints on
the data allowed in the index's <a>referenced</a> object store, such
as requiring uniqueness of the values referenced by the index's
keyPath. If the <a>referenced</a> object store already contains data
which violates these constraints, this must not cause the
implementation of {{IDBObjectStore/createIndex()}} to throw an
exception or affect what it returns. The implementation must still
create and return an {{IDBIndex}} object, and the implementation must
<a>queue a task</a> to abort the <a>upgrade transaction</a> which was
used for the {{IDBObjectStore/createIndex()}} call.

This method synchronously modifies the {{IDBObjectStore/indexNames}}
property on the {{IDBObjectStore}} instance on which it was called.
Although this method does not return an {{IDBRequest}} object, the
index creation itself is processed as an asynchronous request within
the <a>upgrade transaction</a>.

In some implementations it is possible for the implementation to
asynchronously run into problems creating the index after the
createIndex method has returned. For example in implementations where
metadata about the newly created index is queued up to be inserted
into the database asynchronously, or where the implementation might
need to ask the user for permission for quota reasons. Such
implementations must still create and return an {{IDBIndex}} object,
and once the implementation determines that creating the index has
failed, it must abort the transaction using the <a>steps for aborting
a transaction</a> using an appropriate error as |error|. For example
if creating the <a for=/>index</a> failed due to quota reasons,
{{QuotaExceededError}} must be used as error and if the index can't be
created due to <a>unique flag</a> constraints, {{ConstraintError}}
must be used as error.

<aside class=example>

  The asynchronous creation of indexes is observable in the following example:

  <pre class=lang-javascript>
    var request1 = objectStore.put({name: "betty"}, 1);
    var request2 = objectStore.put({name: "betty"}, 2);
    var index = objectStore.createIndex("by_name", "name", {unique: true});
  </pre>

  At the point where {{createIndex()}} called, neither of the
  <a>requests</a> have executed. When the second request executes, a
  duplicate name is created. Since the index creation is considered an
  asynchronous <a>request</a>, the index's <a data-lt="unique
  flag">uniqueness constraint</a> does not cause the second
  <a>request</a> to fail. Instead, the <a for=/>transaction</a> will
  be <a>aborted</a> when the index is created and the constraint
  fails.

The {{IDBIndex}} interface represents an <a>index handle</a>.


<pre class=idl>
[Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
interface IDBIndex {
           attribute DOMString      name;

</pre>


The <dfn attribute for=IDBIndex>name</dfn> attribute's getter must
return this <a>index handle</a>'s <a for=index>name</a>.

<aside class=note>
  As long as the <a for=/>transaction</a> has not <a>finished</a>,
  this is the same as the associated <a for=/>index</a>'s <a
  for=index>name</a>. Once the <a for=/>transaction</a> has
  <a>finished</a>, this attribute will not reflect changes made with a
  later <a>upgrade transaction</a>.
</aside>


The {{IDBIndex/name}} attribute's setter must run these steps:

<div class=algorithm>

1. Let |name| be the given value.

2. Let |transaction| be this <a>index handle</a>'s <a
    for=index-handle>transaction</a>.

3. Let |index| be this <a>index handle</a>'s <a
    for=index-handle>index</a>.

4. If |transaction| is not an <a>upgrade transaction</a>,
    <a>throw</a> an {{InvalidStateError}}.

5. If |transaction| is not <a>active</a>, <a>throw</a> a
    {{TransactionInactiveError}}.

6. If |index| or |index|'s <a for=/>object store</a> has
    been deleted, <a>throw</a> an {{InvalidStateError}}.

7. If |index|'s <a for=index>name</a> is equal to
    |name|, terminate these steps.

8. If an <a for=/>index</a> <a for=index>named</a>
    |name| already exists in |index|'s <a for=/>object
    store</a>, <a>throw</a> a {{ConstraintError}}.

9. Set |index|'s <a for=index>name</a> to
    |name|.

10. Set this <a>index handle</a>'s <a
    for=index-handle>name</a> to |name|.

<aside class=advisement>
  &#x2660; The {{IDBIndex/name}} attribute's setter is new in this
  edition, but not yet shipping in any browsers. &#x2660;
</aside>


The <dfn attribute for=IDBIndex>objectStore</dfn> attribute's getter
must return this <a>index handle</a>'s <a for=index-handle>object
store handle</a>.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBIndex>keyPath</dfn> attribute's getter must
return this <a>index handle</a>'s <a for=index-handle>index</a>'s <a
for=object-store>key path</a>.

The conversion is done following the normal [[!WEBIDL]] binding logic
for {{DOMString}} and <a>sequence&lt;DOMString&gt;</a> values, as
appropriate.

The returned value is not the same instance that was used when the <a
for=/>index</a> was created. However, if this attribute returns an
object (specifically an <a>Array</a>), it returns the same object
instance every time it is inspected. Changing the properties of the
object has no effect on the <a for=/>index</a>.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBIndex>multiEntry</dfn> attribute's getter
must return true if this <a>index handle</a>'s <a
for=index-handle>index</a>'s <a>multiEntry flag</a> is set, and false
otherwise.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBIndex>unique</dfn> attribute's getter must
return true if this <a>index handle</a>'s <a
for=index-handle>index</a>'s <a>unique flag</a> is set, and false
otherwise.


The <dfn method for=IDBIndex>get(|query|)</dfn> method, when invoked,
must run these steps:

<div class=algorithm>

1. Let |transaction| be this <a>index handle</a>'s <a
    for=index-handle>transaction</a>.

2. Let |index| be this <a>index handle</a>'s <a
    for=index-handle>index</a>.

3. If |index| or |index|'s <a for=/>object store</a> has
    been deleted, <a>throw</a> an {{InvalidStateError}}.

4. If |transaction| is not <a>active</a>, <a>throw</a> a
    {{TransactionInactiveError}}.

5. Let |range| be the result of running the steps to
    <a>convert a value to a key range</a> with |query| and
    |null disallowed flag| set. Rethrow any exceptions.

6. Run the <a>steps for asynchronously executing a request</a> and
      return the {{IDBRequest}} created by these steps. The steps
      are run with this <a>index handle</a> as |source| and
      the <a>steps for retrieving a referenced value from an index</a>
      as |operation|, using |index| and
      |range|.

</div>

The |query| parameter may be a <a for=/>key</a> or an
{{IDBKeyRange}} identifying the <a>record</a> to be retrieved. If a
range is specified, the method retrieves the first existing record in
that range.


<aside class=note>
  This method produces the same result if a record with the given key
  doesn't exist as when a record exists, but has undefined as value.
  If you need to tell the two situations apart, you can use
  {{IDBIndex/openCursor()}} with the same key. This will return a
  cursor with undefined as value if a record exists, or no cursor if
  no such record exists.
</aside>


The <dfn method for=IDBIndex>getKey(|query|)</dfn> method, when
invoked, must run these steps:

<div class=algorithm>

1. Let |transaction| be this <a>index handle</a>'s <a
    for=index-handle>transaction</a>.

2. Let |index| be this <a>index handle</a>'s <a
    for=index-handle>index</a>.

3. If |index| or |index|'s <a for=/>object store</a> has been deleted,
    <a>throw</a> an {{InvalidStateError}}.

4. If |transaction| is not <a>active</a>, <a>throw</a> a
    {{TransactionInactiveError}}.

5. Let |range| be the result of running the steps to <a>convert a
    value to a key range</a> with |query| and |null disallowed flag|
    set. Rethrow any exceptions.

6. Run the <a>steps for asynchronously executing a request</a> and
    return the {{IDBRequest}} created by these steps. The steps are
    run with this <a>index handle</a> as |source| and the <a>steps for
    retrieving a value from an index</a> as |operation|, using |index|
    and |range|.

</div>

The |query| parameter may be a <a for=/>key</a> or an
{{IDBKeyRange}} identifying the <a>record</a> key to be retrieved.
If a range is specified, the method retrieves the first existing key
in that range.


The <dfn method for=IDBIndex>getAll(|query|, |count|)</dfn> method,
when invoked, must run these steps:

<div class=algorithm>

1. Let |transaction| be this <a>index handle</a>'s <a
    for=index-handle>transaction</a>.

2. Let |index| be this <a>index handle</a>'s <a
    for=index-handle>index</a>.

3. If |index| or |index|'s <a for=/>object store</a> has
    been deleted, <a>throw</a> an {{InvalidStateError}}.

4. If |transaction| is not <a>active</a>, <a>throw</a> a
    {{TransactionInactiveError}}.

5. Let |range| be the result of running the steps to
    <a>convert a value to a key range</a> with |query|.
    Rethrow any exceptions.

6. Run the <a>steps for asynchronously executing a request</a> and
    return the {{IDBRequest}} created by these steps. The steps are
    run with this <a>index handle</a> as |source| and the <a>steps for
    retrieving multiple referenced values from an index</a> as
    |operation|, using |index|, |range|, and |count| if given.

</div>

The |query| parameter may be a <a for=/>key</a> or an {{IDBKeyRange}}
identifying the <a>records</a> to be retrieved. If null or not given,
an <a>unbounded key range</a> is used. If |count| is specified and
there are more than |count| records in range, only the first |count|
will be retrieved.

<h3 id=cursor-interface>The {{IDBCursor}} interface</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

<a>Cursor</a> objects implement the {{IDBCursor}} interface. There
is only ever one {{IDBCursor}} instance representing a given
<a>cursor</a>. There is no limit on how many cursors can be used at
the same time.


<pre class=idl>
[Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
interface IDBCursor {
  readonly attribute (IDBObjectStore or IDBIndex) source;
  readonly attribute IDBCursorDirection           direction;
  readonly attribute any                          key;
  readonly attribute any                          primaryKey;

  void advance([EnforceRange] unsigned long count);

  IDBRequest update(any value);
  IDBRequest delete();
};

enum IDBCursorDirection {
  "next",
  "nextunique",
  "prev",
  "prevunique"
};
</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=IDBCursor>source</dfn> attribute's getter must
return the <a for=cursor>source</a> of this <a>cursor</a>. This
attribute never returns null or throws an exception, even if the
cursor is currently being iterated, has iterated past its end, or its
<a for=/>transaction</a> is not <a>active</a>.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBCursor>direction</dfn> attribute's getter
must return the <a>direction</a> of the <a>cursor</a>.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBCursor>key</dfn> attribute's getter must
return the result of running the steps to <a>convert a key to a
value</a> with the cursor's current <a for=cursor>key</a>. Note that
if this property returns an object (e.g. a <a>Date</a> or
<a>Array</a>), it returns the same object instance every time it is
inspected, until the cursor's <a for=cursor>key</a> is changed. This
means that if the object is modified, those modifications will be seen
by anyone inspecting the value of the cursor. However modifying such
an object does not modify the contents of the database.

The <dfn attribute for=IDBCursor>primaryKey</dfn> attribute's getter
must return the result of running the steps to <a>convert a key to a
value</a> with the cursor's current <a>effective key</a>. Note that if
this property returns an object (e.g. a <a>Date</a> or <a>Array</a>),
it returns the same object instance every time it is inspected, until
the cursor's <a>effective key</a> is changed. This means that if the
object is modified, those modifications will be seen by anyone
inspecting the value of the cursor. However modifying such an object
does not modify the contents of the database.


The <dfn method for=IDBCursor>update(|value|)</dfn> method, when
invoked, must run these steps:

<div class=algorithm>

1. Let |transaction| be this <a>cursor</a>'s <a
    for=cursor>transaction</a>.

2. If |transaction| is not <a>active</a>, <a>throw</a> a
    {{TransactionInactiveError}}.

3. If |transaction| is a <a>read-only transaction</a>, <a>throw</a> a
    {{ReadOnlyError}}.

4. If the cursor's <a for=cursor>source</a> or <a>effective object
    store</a> has been deleted, <a>throw</a> an {{InvalidStateError}}.

5. If this cursor's <a>got value flag</a> is unset, indicating that
    the cursor is being iterated or has iterated past its end,
    <a>throw</a> an {{InvalidStateError}}.

6. If this cursor's <a>key only flag</a> is set, <a>throw</a> an
    {{InvalidStateError}}.

7. Let |clone| be <a>structured clone</a> of |value|. Rethrow any
    exceptions.

8. If the <a>effective object store</a> of this cursor uses <a>in-line
    keys</a>, run these substeps:

    1. Let |kpk| be the result of running the steps to
        <a>extract a key from a value using a key path</a> with
        |clone| and the <a for=object-store>key
        path</a> of the <a>effective object store</a>.
        Rethrow any exceptions.

    2. If |kpk| is failure, invalid, or not <a>equal to</a>
        the cursor's <a>effective key</a>, <a>throw</a> a
        {{DataError}}.

9. Run <a>steps for asynchronously executing a request</a> and return
    the {{IDBRequest}} created by these steps. The steps are run with
    this <a>cursor</a> as |source| and the <a>steps for storing a
    record into an object store</a> as |operation|, using this
    cursor's <a>effective object store</a> as |store|, the |clone| as
    |value|, this cursor's <a>effective key</a> as |key|, and with the
    |no-overwrite flag| unset.

</div>

<aside class=note>
  A result of running the <a>steps for storing a record into an object
  store</a> is that if the record has been deleted since the cursor
  moved to it, a new record will be created.
</aside>


The <dfn method for=IDBCursor>advance(|count|)</dfn> method, when

</pre>

The <dfn attribute for=IDBCursorWithValue>value</dfn> attribute's
getter must return the cursor's current <a for=cursor>value</a>. Note
that if this property returns an object, it returns the same object
instance every time it is inspected, until the cursor's <a

<aside class=note>
  If this <a for=/>transaction</a> was aborted due to a failed

  {{AbortError}}. If the <a for=/>transaction</a> was aborted due to
  an error while committing, it will reflect the reason for the

</aside>


The <dfn method for=IDBTransaction>objectStore(|name|)</dfn> method,
when invoked, must run these steps:

<h3 id=opening>Opening a database</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

The <dfn>steps for opening a database</dfn> are defined in the
following steps. The algorithm in these steps takes four arguments:
the |origin| which requested the <a>database</a> to be opened, a
database |name|, a database |version|, and a |request|.

<div class=algorithm>

1. Let |db| be the <a>database</a> <a for=database>named</a> |name| in the
    origin |origin|, or null otherwise.

2. If |db| is not null, run these substeps:

    1. Wait until the following conditions are all fulfilled:

        * No already existing <a for=/>connections</a> to |db|, have
            non-<a>finished</a> <a>upgrade transaction</a>.

        * If |db| has its <a>delete pending flag</a> set, wait until
            |db| has been deleted.

        <aside class=note>
          If several requests with the same |origin| and |name| are
          waiting due to the above conditions, and those connections
          have a higher version than the database's current version,
          then once any of those connections can proceed to the next
          step in this algorithm it will immediately start an
          <a>upgrade transaction</a>. This prevents the other
          connections from proceeding until that <a>upgrade
          transaction</a> is finished.
        </aside>

    2. If |db| was deleted, let |db| be null.

3. If |version| is undefined, let |version| be 1 if |db| is null, or
    |db|'s <a for=database>version</a> otherwise.

4. If |db| is null, let |db| be a new <a>database</a> with <a
    for=database>name</a> |name|, <a for=database>version</a> 0
    (zero), and with no <a for=/>object stores</a>.

5. If |db|'s <a for=database>version</a> is greater than |version|,
    abort these steps and return a new {{VersionError}}.

6. Let |connection| be a new <a for=/>connection</a> to |db|.

7. Set |connection|'s <a for=connection>version</a> to |version|.

8. If |db|'s <a for=database>version</a> is less than |version|, run
    these substeps:

    1. Run the <a>steps for running an upgrade transaction</a>
        using |connection|, |version| and |request|.

    2. If |connection| was <a for=connection>closed</a>, create and
        return a newly <a lt="create exception">created</a>
        {{AbortError}} and abort these steps.

    3. If the <a>upgrade transaction</a> was aborted, run the <a>steps
        for closing a database connection</a> with |connection|,
        create and return a newly <a lt="create exception">created</a>
        {{AbortError}} and abort these steps.

9. Return |connection|.

</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=closing-connection>Closing a database</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

The <dfn>steps for closing a database connection</dfn> are as follows.
These steps take two arguments, a |connection| object, and an
optional |forced flag|.

<div class=algorithm>

1. Set the <a>close pending flag</a> of |connection|.

2. If the |forced flag| is set, then for each |transaction|
    <a>created</a> using |connection| run the <a>steps for aborting a
    transaction</a> with |transaction| and newly <a lt="create
    exception">created</a> {{AbortError}}.

3. Wait for all transactions <a>created</a> using |connection| to complete.
    Once they are complete, |connection| is <a for=connection>closed</a>.

4. If the |forced flag| is set, then fire a <code>close</code> event
    at |connection|. The event must use the <a>Event</a> interface and
    have its type set to "<code>close</code>". The event must not
    bubble or be cancelable.

    <aside class=note>
      &#9752; This behavior is new in this edition. &#9752;
    </aside>

</div>

<aside class=note>
  Once the <a>close pending flag</a> has been set no new transactions
  can be <a>created</a> using |connection|. All methods that
  <a>create</a> transactions first check the <a>close pending flag</a>
  first and throw an exception if it is set.
</aside>

<aside class=note>
  Once the <a for=/>connection</a> is closed, this can unblock the
  <a>steps for running an upgrade transaction</a>, and the <a>steps
  for deleting a database</a>, which <a
  href="#delete-close-block">both</a> <a
  href="#version-change-close-block">wait</a> for <a
  for=/>connections</a> to a given <a>database</a> to be closed before
  continuing.
</aside>


<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=deleting-a-database>Deleting a database</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

The <dfn>steps for deleting a database</dfn> are as follows.
The algorithm in these steps takes three arguments:
the |origin| that requested the <a>database</a> to be deleted,
a database |name|,
and a |request|.

<div class=algorithm>

1. Let |db| be the <a>database</a> with the given name from the origin
    |origin|, if one exists. Otherwise, return 0 (zero).

2. Set |db|'s <a>delete pending flag</a>.

3. Let |openConnections| be the set of all <a for=/>connections</a>
    associated with |db|.

4. For each |entry| in |openConnections| that does not have its
    <a>close pending flag</a> set, <a>fire a version change event</a>
    named <code>versionchange</code> at |entry| with |db|'s <a
    for=database>version</a> and null.

    <aside class=note>
      Firing this event might cause one or more of the other objects
      in |openConnections| to be closed, in which case the
      <code>versionchange</code> event must not be fired at those
      objects if that hasn't yet been done.
    </aside>

5. If any of the <a for=/>connections</a> in |openConnections| are
    still not closed, <a>fire a version change event</a> named
    <code>blocked</code> at |request| with |db|'s <a
    for=database>version</a> and null.

6. <span id="delete-close-block">Wait</span> until all <a
    for=/>connections</a> in |openConnections| are <a
    for=connection>closed</a> and all of their transactions are
    <a>finished</a>.

7. Let |version| be |db|'s <a for=database>version</a>.

8. Delete |db|.

9. Return |version|.

</div>


<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=commit-transaction>Steps for committing a transaction</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

When taking the <dfn>steps for committing a transaction</dfn> the
implementation must execute the following algorithm. This algorithm
takes one argument, the |transaction| to commit.

<div class=algorithm>

1. All the changes made to the <a>database</a> by |transaction| are
    written to the <a>database</a>.

2. If an error occurs while writing the changes to the
    <a>database</a>, abort the transaction by following the <a>steps
    for aborting a transaction</a> with |transaction| and an
    appropriate for the error, for example {{QuotaExceededError}} or
    {{UnknownError}}.

3. <a>Queue a task</a> to dispatch an event at |transaction|. The
    event must use the <a>Event</a> interface and have its
    {{Event/type}} set to "<code>complete</code>". The event does not
    bubble and is not cancelable.

    <aside class=note>
      Even if an exception is thrown from one of the event handlers of
      this event, the transaction is still committed since writing the
      database changes happens before the event takes places. Only
      after the transaction has been successfully written is the
      "<code>complete</code>" event fired.
    </aside>

</div>


<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=abort-transaction>Steps for aborting a transaction</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

When taking the <dfn>steps for aborting a transaction</dfn> the
implementation must execute the following algorithm. This algorithm
takes two arguments: the |transaction| to abort, and |error|.

<div class=algorithm>

1. All the changes made to the <a>database</a> by the <a
    for=/>transaction</a> are reverted. For <a>upgrade
    transactions</a> this includes changes to the set of <a
    for=/>object stores</a> and <a for=/>indexes</a>, as well as the
    change to the <a for=database>version</a>. Any <a for=/>object
    stores</a> and <a for=/>indexes</a> which were created during the
    transaction are now considered deleted for the purposes of other
    algorithms.

2. If |transaction| is an <a>upgrade transactions</a>, run the
    <a>steps for aborting an upgrade transaction</a> with
    |transaction|. This reverts changes to all <a
    for=/>connection</a>, <a for=/>object store handle</a>, and
    <a>index handle</a> instances associated with |transaction|.

3. If |error| is not null, set |transaction|'s <a
    for=transaction>error</a> to |error|.

4. For each |request| in |transaction|'s <a>request list</a> with
    <a>done flag</a> unset, abort the <a>steps for asynchronously
    executing a request</a> for |request| and <a>queue a task</a> to
    run these substeps:

    1. Set the <a>done flag</a> on |request|.
    2. Set the <a for=request>result</a> of |request| to undefined.
    3. Set the <a for=request>error</a> of |request| to a newly
        <a lt="create exception">created</a> {{AbortError}}.
    4. Dispatch an event at |request|. The event must use the
        <a>Event</a> interface and have its {{Event/type}} set to
        "<code>error</code>". The event bubbles and is cancelable.

    <aside class=note>
      This does not always result in any <code>error</code> events
      being fired. For example if a transaction is aborted due to an
      error while <a for=transaction>committing</a> the transaction,
      or if it was the last remaining request that failed.
    </aside>

5. <a>Queue a task</a> to dispatch an event at |transaction|. The
    event must use the <a>Event</a> interface and have its
    {{Event/type}} set to "<code>abort</code>". The event does bubble
    but is not cancelable.

</div>


<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h3 id=async-execute-request>Steps for asynchronously executing a <a>request</a></h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

When taking the <dfn>steps for asynchronously executing a
request</dfn> the implementation must run the following algorithm. The
algorithm takes a |source| object and an |operation| to perform on a
database, and an optional |request|.

These steps can be aborted at any point if the <a
for=/>transaction</a> the created <a>request</a> belongs to is

<h3 id=upgrade-transaction-steps>Upgrade transaction steps</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

The <dfn>steps for running an upgrade transaction</dfn> are as
follows. This algorithm takes three arguments: a |connection| object
which is used to update the <a>database</a>, a new |version| to be set
for the <a>database</a>, and a |request|.

<div class=algorithm>

1. Let |openConnections| be the set of all <a for=/>connections</a>,
    except |connection|, connected to the same <a>database</a> as
    |connection|.

2. For each |entry| in |openConnections| that does not have its
    <a>close pending flag</a> set, <a>fire a version change event</a>
    named <code>versionchange</code> at |entry| with |db|'s <a
    for=database>version</a> and |version|.

    <aside class=note>
      Firing this event might cause one or more of the other objects
      in |openConnections| to be closed, in which case the
      <code>versionchange</code> event must not be fired at those
      objects if that hasn't yet been done.
    </aside>

3. If any of the <a for=/>connections</a> in |openConnections| are
    still not closed, <a>fire a version change event</a> named
    <dfn><code>blocked</code></dfn> at |request| with |db|'s <a
    for=database>version</a> and |version|.

4. <span id="version-change-close-block">Wait</span> until all <a
    for=/>connections</a> in |openConnections| are <a
    for=connection>closed</a> and all of their transactions are
    <a>finished</a>.

5. Let |transaction| be a new <a>upgrade transaction</a> with
    |connection| used as <a for=/>connection</a>. The <a>scope</a> of
    |transaction| includes every <a for=/>object store</a> in
    |connection|.

6. Unset |transaction|'s <a>active flag</a>.

7. Start |transaction|. Note that until this <a for=/>transaction</a>
    is finished, no other <a for=/>connections</a> can be opened to
    the same <a>database</a>.

8. Let |old version| be |database|'s <a for=database>version</a>.

9. Set the version of |database| to |version|. This change is
    considered part of the <a for=/>transaction</a>, and so if the
    transaction is <a>aborted</a>, this change is reverted.

10. <a>Queue a task</a> to run the following steps:

    1. Set |request|'s <a for=request>result</a> to |connection|.
    2. Set |request|'s <a for=request>transaction</a> to |transaction|.
    3. Set the <a>done flag</a> on the <a>request</a>.
    4. <a>Fire a version change event</a> named
        <dfn><code>upgradeneeded</code></dfn> at |request| with |old
        version| and |version|.
    5. If an exception was propagated out from any event handler while
        dispatching the event in the previous step, abort the
        transaction by following the <a>steps for aborting a
        transaction</a> with the |error| property set to a newly
        <a lt="create exception">created</a> {{AbortError}}.

11. Execute transaction.

12. If |transaction| is aborted for any reason, the <a>steps for
    aborting a transaction</a> must be run.

13. When |transaction| is finished, immediately set |request|'s <a
    for=request>transaction</a> to null. This must be done in the same
    task as the task firing the <code>complete</code> or
    <code>abort</code> event, but after the event has been fired.

  including the set of associated <a for=/>object stores</a> and <a
  for=/>indexes</a>, as well as the change to the <a
  for=database>version</a>.
</aside>

<div class=algorithm>

1. Let |connection| be |transaction|'s <a for=/>connection</a>.

2. Let |database| be |connection|'s <a>database</a>.

3. Set |connection|'s <a for=connection>version</a> to |database|'s <a
    for=database>version</a> if |database| previously existed, or 0 (zero)
    if |database| was newly created.

    <aside class=note>
      This reverts the value of {{IDBDatabase/version}} returned by the
      {{IDBDatabase}} object.
    </aside>

4. Set |connection|'s <a>object store set</a> to the set of <a
    for=/>object stores</a> in |database| if |database| previously
    existed, or the empty set if |database| was newly created.

    <aside class=note>
      This reverts the value of {{IDBDatabase/objectStoreNames}} returned
      by the {{IDBDatabase}} object.
    </aside>

5. For each <a for=/>object store handle</a> |handle| associated with
    |transaction|, including those for <a for=/>object stores</a> that
    were deleted during |transaction|, run these substeps:

    1. Set |handle|'s <a for=object-store-handle>name</a> to its <a
        for=object-store-handle>object store</a>'s
        <a for=object-store>name</a>.

To <dfn>fire a success event</dfn> at a <a>request</a>,
the implementation must run the following steps:

1. Set |transaction| to the <a for=/>transaction</a> associated with
    the <a for=request>source</a>.

2. Set the <a>active flag</a> of |transaction|.

3. Dispatch an event at <a>request</a>. The event must use the

    "<code>success</code>". The event does not bubble and is not
    cancelable.

4. Unset the <a>active flag</a> of |transaction|.

5. If an exception was propagated out from any event handler while
    dispatching the event in step 3, abort the transaction by
    following the <a>steps for aborting a transaction</a> with
    |transaction| and a newly <a lt="create exception">created</a>

    <aside class=note>
      This means that if an error event is fired and any of the event

<h3 id=object-store-storage-operation>Object Store Storage Operation</h3>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

The <dfn>steps for storing a record into an object store</dfn> with
|store|, |value|, an optional |key|, and a |no-overwrite flag| are as
follows.

<div class=algorithm>

1. If |store| uses <a>in-line keys</a>, run these substeps:

    1. Let |kpk| be the result of running the steps to <a>extract a
        key from a value using a key path</a> with |value| and
        |store|'s <a for=object-store>key path</a>.

    2. Assert: |kpk| will not be invalid or an exception.

    3. If |kpk| is not failure, let |key| be |kpk|.

2. If |store| uses a <a>key generator</a>, run these substeps:

    1. If |key| is undefined, run these substeps:

        1. If the <a>key generator</a>'s <a>current number</a> is
            greater than 2<sup>53</sup> (9007199254740992), then this
            operation failed with a {{ConstraintError}}. Abort this
            algorithm without taking any further steps.

        2. Set |key| to the <a>key generator</a>'s <a>current number</a>

        3. Increase the <a>key generator</a>'s <a>current number</a> by 1.

        4. If |store| also uses <a>in-line keys</a>, then run the
            steps to <a>inject a key into a value using a key path</a>
            with |value|, |key| and |store|'s <a for=object-store>key
            path</a>.

    2. Otherwise, if the <a for=key>type</a> of |key| is <i>number</i>
        and the <a for=key>value</a> is greater than or equal to the
        <a>key generator</a>'s <a>current number</a>, set the
        <a>current number</a> to lowest integer greater than |key|.

3. If the |no-overwrite flag| was given to these steps and is set, and
    a <a>record</a> already exists in |store| with its key <a>equal
    to</a> |key|, then this operation failed with a
    {{ConstraintError}}. Abort this algorithm without taking any
    further steps.

4. If a <a>record</a> already exists in |store| with its key <a>equal
    to</a> |key|, then remove the <a>record</a> from |store| using the
    <a>steps for deleting records from an object store</a>.

5. Store a record in |store| containing |key| as its key and |value|
    as its value. The record is stored in the object store's <a
    for=object-store>list of records</a> such that the list is sorted
    according key of the records in ascending order.

6. For each |index| which <a>reference</a> |store|, run these substeps:

    1. Let |index key| be the result of running the steps to
        <a>extract a key from a value using a key path</a> with
        |value|, |index|'s <a for=index>key path</a>, and |index|'s
        <a>multiEntry flag</a>.

    2. If |index key| is an exception, or invalid, or failure, take no
        further actions for this index, and continue these substeps
        for the next index.

        <aside class=note>
          An exception thrown in this step is not rethrown.
        </aside>

    3. If |index|'s <a>multiEntry flag</a> is unset, or if |index key|
        is not an <a>array key</a>, and if |index| already contains a
        <a>record</a> with <a for=/>key</a> <a>equal to</a> |index
        key|, and |index| has its <a>unique flag</a> set, then this
        operation failed with a {{ConstraintError}}. Abort this
        algorithm without taking any further steps.

    4. If |index|'s <a>multiEntry flag</a> is set and |index key| is
        an <a>array key</a>, and if |index| already contains a
        <a>record</a> with <a for=/>key</a> <a>equal to</a> any of the
        <a>subkeys</a> of |index key|, and |index| has its <a>unique
        flag</a> set, then this operation failed with a
        {{ConstraintError}}. Abort this algorithm without taking any
        further steps.

    5. If |index|'s <a>multiEntry flag</a> is unset, or if |index key|
        is not an <a>array key</a> then store a record in |index|
        containing |index key| as its key and |key| as its value. The
        record is stored in |index|'s <a for=index>list of records</a>
        such that the list is sorted primarily on the records keys,
        and secondarily on the records values, in ascending order.

    6. If |index|'s <a>multiEntry flag</a> is set and |index key| is
        an <a>array key</a>, then for each |subkey| of the
        <a>subkeys</a> of |index key| store a record in |index|
        containing |subkey| as its key and |key| as its value. The
        records are stored in |index|'s <a for=index>list of
        records</a> such that the list is sorted primarily on the
        records keys, and secondarily on the records values, in
        ascending order.

        <aside class=note>
          It is valid for there to be no <a>subkeys</a>. In this case
          no records are added to the index.
        </aside>

        <aside class=note>
          Even if any member of <a>subkeys</a> is an <a>array key</a>,
          the member is used directly as the key for the index record.
          Nested <a>array keys</a> are not flattened or "unpacked" to
          produce multiple rows; only the outer-most <a>array key</a>

<h3 id=user-tracking>User tracking</h3>

A third-party host (or any object capable of getting content
distributed to multiple sites) could use a unique identifier stored in
its client-side database to track a user across multiple sessions,
building a profile of the user's activities. In conjunction with a
site that is aware of the user's real id object (for example an
e-commerce site that requires authenticated credentials), this could
allow oppressive groups to target individuals with greater accuracy
than in a world with purely anonymous Web usage.

There are a number of techniques that can be used to mitigate the risk
of user tracking:


<dl>
<dt>Blocking third-party storage</dt>
<dd>
User agents may restrict access to the database objects
to scripts originating at the domain of the top-level document of
the <span>browsing context</span>, for instance denying access to
the API for pages from other domains running in <code>iframe</code>s.
</dd>

<dt>Expiring stored data</dt>
<dd>

User agents may automatically delete stored data after a period
of time.

This can restrict the ability of a site to track a user, as the
site would then only be able to track the user across multiple
sessions when she authenticates with the site itself (e.g. by
making a purchase or logging in to a service).


However, this also puts the user's data at risk.
</dd>

<dt>Treating persistent storage as cookies</dt>
<dd>

User agents should present the database feature
to the user in a way that associates them strongly with HTTP
session cookies. [[COOKIES]]

This might encourage users to view such storage with healthy
suspicion.

</dd>

<dt>Site-specific white-listing of access to databases</dt>
<dd>

User agents may require the user to authorize access to
databases before a site can use the feature.

</dd>

<dt>Origin-tracking of stored data</dt>
<dd>

User agents may record the <a>origins</a>
of sites that contained content from third-party origins that
caused data to be stored.

If this information is then used to present the view of data
currently in persistent storage, it would allow the user to make
informed decisions about which parts of the persistent storage to
prune. Combined with a blacklist ("delete this data and prevent
this domain from ever storing data again"), the user can restrict
the use of persistent storage to sites that she trusts.

</dd>

<dt>Shared blacklists</dt>
<dd>

User agents may allow users to share their persistent storage
domain blacklists.

This would allow communities to act together to protect their
privacy.

</dd>
</dl>

While these suggestions prevent trivial use of this API for user
tracking, they do not block it altogether. Within a single domain, a
site can continue to track the user during a session, and can then
pass all this information to the third party along with any
identifying information (names, credit card numbers, addresses)
obtained by the site. If a third party cooperates with multiple
sites to obtain such information, a profile can still be
created.

However, user tracking is to some extent possible even with no
cooperation from the user agent whatsoever, for instance by using
session identifiers in URLs, a technique already commonly used for
innocuous purposes but easily repurposed for user tracking (even
retroactively). This information can then be shared with other
sites, using using visitors' IP addresses and other user-specific
data (e.g. user-agent headers and configuration settings) to combine
separate sessions into coherent user profiles.

<h3 id=cookie-resurrection>Cookie resurrection</h3>

If the user interface for persistent storage presents data in the
persistent storage features described in this specification
separately from data in HTTP session cookies, then users are likely
to delete data in one and not the other. This would allow sites to
use the two features as redundant backup for each other, defeating a
user's attempts to protect his privacy.


<h3 id=sensitivity-of-data>Sensitivity of data</h3>

User agents should treat persistently stored data as potentially
sensitive; it is quite possible for e-mails, calendar appointments,
health records, or other confidential documents to be stored in this
mechanism.

To this end, user agents should ensure that when deleting data,
it is promptly deleted from the underlying storage.

<h3 id=dns-spoofing-attacks>DNS spoofing attacks</h3>

Because of the potential for DNS spoofing attacks, one cannot
guarantee that a host claiming to be in a certain domain really is
from that domain. To mitigate this, pages can use SSL. Pages using
SSL can be sure that only pages using SSL that have certificates
identifying them as being from the same domain can access their
databases.


<h3 id=cross-directory-attacks>Cross-directory attacks</h3>

Different authors sharing one host name, for example users
hosting content on <code>geocities.com</code>, all share one
set of databases.

There is no feature to restrict the access by pathname. Authors on
shared hosts are therefore recommended to avoid using these
features, as it would be trivial for other authors to read the data
and overwrite it.

<aside class=note>
  Even if a path-restriction feature was made available, the usual DOM
  scripting security model would make it trivial to bypass this
  protection and access the data from any path.
</aside>

<h3 id=implementation-risks>Implementation risks</h3>

The two primary risks when implementing these persistent storage
features are letting hostile sites read information from other
domains, and letting hostile sites write information that is then
read from other domains.

Letting third-party sites read data that is not supposed to be
read from their domain causes <em>information leakage</em>, For
example, a user's shopping wish list on one domain could be used by
another domain for targeted advertising; or a user's
work-in-progress confidential documents stored by a word-processing
site could be examined by the site of a competing company.

Letting third-party sites write data to the persistent storage of
other domains can result in <em>information spoofing</em>, which is
equally dangerous. For example, a hostile site could add records to a
user's wish list; or a hostile site could set a user's session
identifier to a known ID that the hostile site can then use to track
the user's actions on the victim site.

Thus, strictly following the <span>origin</span> model described
in this specification is important for user security.
